## Overview :point_left:
---

## in this project i will compined advanced technique in computer vision to find lane line
## using camera calibration and how to undistortion image 
## and make prespective transform on image

---
## steps of project :
---
### Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.

### Apply a distortion correction to raw images. Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image

### Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").

### Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.

### Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.

### Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.

### Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle

### applay this steps on video stream.
