## steps of project :
---
1- Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.

2- Apply a distortion correction to raw images. Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a *thresholded binary image *bold text

3- Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").

4- Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.

5- Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.

6- Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.

7- Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle

8- applay this steps on video stream.
